# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props in React is a way of connecting a set of data to be called repeatedly without having to write the code over and over.

  Researched answer: Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. Only from parent to child.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: a DOM event is command that runs in the DOM

  Researched answer: DOM (Document Object Model) Events are a signal that something has occurred, or is occurring, and can be triggered by user interactions or by the browser. Such as:

When a user clicks the mouse
When a web page has loaded
When an image has been loaded
When the mouse moves over an element
When an input field is changed
When an HTML form is submitted
When a user presses a key[2]



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a way of writing code in which objects are used to contain data for ease of calling pieces of data repeatedly. It's different from functional programming in that object oriented is only using objects and functional programming could be using any type of data storage options.

  Researched answer:
Object-oriented programming is a  model that uses software design based on data, or objects. Functional programming is a model that uses functions and logic.


4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: The difference is an Integer is just a whole number, where as a float is the number with a decimal point to specify it is a float.

  Researched answer:
  a float in a Ruby program is a number that contains a decimal point. Ruby will consider any number written without decimals as an integer (as in 138 ) and any number written with decimals as a float 
  



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It means that the last line is automatically returned, no need to type return.

  Researched answer:
  when return isn't explicitly called within a method then Ruby returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static.

2. PostgreSQL: ree and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

3. Ruby on Rails: a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages

4. ORM: Object–relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

5. Active Record: In software engineering, the active record pattern is considered an architectural pattern by some people and as an anti-pattern by some others recently. It is found in software that stores in-memory object data in relational databases.
